This manifest is a test file created to validate the DICOCH specification â€” a cultural heritage metadata extension of the DICOM standard â€” and to assess its interoperability and public delivery capabilities via the IIIF framework.

CT Projection Sample File: slice0300.jpg
This image represents a raw CT projection slice used to evaluate IIIF-based rendering pipelines.

ROI-Annotated Demo CT Slice Sample File: slice0900.jpg
This image includes clearly marked regions of interest (ROIs), intended for metadata alignment and viewer-level annotation validation.

ROI Coordinate Data Extracted via ImageJ: XY_Coordinates_slice0300_ROI_1_2.xlsx, XY_Coordinates_slice0900_ROI.xlsx
This spreadsheet contains the exact XY coordinate data of selected ROIs extracted from slice0300.jpg, slice0900.jpg using ImageJ.

By supplying the manifest located at
ðŸ”— (https://song-jung-il.github.io/Public_image/json_manifest.json)
to the Mirador viewer demo
ðŸ”— https://projectmirador.org/demo/,
standardized IIIF image presentation can be tested and validated.

This approach enables consistent and interoperable delivery of cultural heritage X-ray/CT images via IIIF-compliant viewers â€” an essential step toward aligning DICOM-based metadata models with IIIF's presentation and accessibility standards.
